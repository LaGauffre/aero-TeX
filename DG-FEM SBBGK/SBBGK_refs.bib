@article{Yang2006,
	abstract = "A novel kinetic beam scheme for the ideal quantum gas is presented for the computation of quantum gas dynamical flows. The quantum Boltzmann equation approach is adopted and the local thermodynamic equilibrium quantum distribution is assumed. Both Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac gases are considered. Formulae for one spatial dimension is first derived and the resulting beam scheme is tested for shock tube flows. Implementation of high-order methods is also outlined. We only consider the system in the normal phase consisting of particles in excited states and both the classical limit and the nearly degenerate limit are computed. The flow structures can all be accurately captured by the present beam scheme. Formulations for multiple spatial dimensions are also included.",
