% Abstract
\begin{abstract}
During the recent years, Discontinuous Galerkin Methods (DGM) have become widely popular and have attracted the attention of many CFD and numerical practitioners due to its great accuaracy and the parallel advangates that the method provides to solve partial differential equations. DG methods takes the best of two worlds, i.e. the simplicity and fundamentals conservative principles of finite volume formulations and the domain flexibility of spectral methods such us finite element methods. Is in this context that new practitioners like the present author starts its own journey in learning the method's formulation, numerical implementation and formulation for practical applications.
