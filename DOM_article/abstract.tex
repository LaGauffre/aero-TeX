	In this article three numerical methods for discretising and recovering the macroscopic proprerties in model kinectic equations are studied and compared. These Methods are specifically tradiational discrete ordinate method (DOM), conservative DOM and dynamic DOM . Each proposals is made to improve on the traditional DOM. Efforts are been done in the present article to combine the best of the startegies mentioned in efforts to produce a relaible and computationally efficient method in modeling boltzmann equation using approximate collision operators such as Bhatnagar, Gross and Krook (BGK) model and Ellipsoidal-BGK, best known as ES-BGK.
