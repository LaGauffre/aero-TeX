\section{Introduction}
facts:
1. The correct description of rarefied gas flows is based on the boltzmann kinetic equation for the molecular velocity distribution function. 
2. Boltzmann Equation model is a integro differential equation due to the non-linear multidimensional collision operator.  
3. It is very difficult to deal the non-linear multidimensional collision operator in kinetic Boltzmann, therefore much attention has been put in to replacing the exact collision operator in with approximation models which render more simpler kinetic equations. 
4. Examples of this approximation funcions include the classica Bhatagar-Gross and Krock (BGK) model and Ellipsodal BGK model (ES-BGK). 
5.
