Aero-wolfram repository

This GIT repo is just a version control for most of my TeX files for my lecture notes, homeworks, reports and articles.
Wanna to copy something? I'll save you some time. Check folders: 
 1.Headers&Templates/Article
 2.Headers&Templates/Beamer 
 3.Headers&Templates/BeamerStockton 
And test some of the examples files. I believe these are the most usefull files you can find here.

This files where created and compiled without problems using Texlive2012 and latest Texpad app por iPad.

Enjoy ;)
